							<h2>About me</h2>
							<p>My name is Nabil Canan, I moved to this country in 2004 from Paraguay Asuncion. My father got a job opportunity to work for a nonprofit Christian organization that helped people in rehab all around the world. Iâ€™ve worked to support my family from high school until the end of college. I worked full time and went to school full time, in the process I became fascinated by tech in High school and shortly realized that this was the field I wanted to pursue when I finished high school. I learned a ton on my own and then found this enormous side of tech called software engineering and became fascinated with all the opportunities. I started my journey at Massasoit, then Bridgewater state university where I will be earning my Bachelors in Computer Science in May and I plan on perusing my masters in Data Analytics in the fall as well. I am very excited to see what the future has in store. </p>

							<h2>Database Project</h2>
							<p>What this program does: 
								This project was part of my database final, and we were to write a new database from the script to the working GUI. This 
								project uses SQL and HTML. Here I did a fully working grocery store with items containing each individual information and the user can go through and see
								the item they want along with price, weight etc. The goal of this project was to be able to use the CRUD method which is 
							 	Create Read Update and Delete. This project also used DB browser and I was able to produce my database there with working 
								queries and producing the any outcome the user needed before pushing to the GUI. </p>
